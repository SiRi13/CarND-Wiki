# Term 3 Project 3: System Integration

Project URL: https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Capstone

In this project you will write a Robot Operating System (ROS) that will first steer a virtual car in the simulator,
and later on your code will be run on an actual car named Carla provided by Udacity.

## Known issues & typical problems

- ROS only works on Linux. You will need to install Ubuntu 16.04 if you want a native installation, or use the provided Docker file to run a preconfigured ROS installation on Ubuntu 16.04 inside a virtual machine on your Mac or Windows host.
- Performance really is key here. You can get a long way using the Docker image, but to really test your project on the simulator you will need a fast machine and probably a NVIDIA GPU for the traffic light recognition.
- If your ROS does not connect with the simulator try restarting ROS or the simulator. The setup is a little bit flaky.

## rosbag debugging

When your project submission fails the review feedback alone usually is not enough to find out what went wrong.
However, Udacity will give you a [bag file](http://wiki.ros.org/Bags) that contains all topics data - including logs,
steering messages, raw image data, LIDAR data etc. Let's see how we can get useful info out of it!

### Extract topics as CSV files

**TODO**

### Get all images (and video)

**TODO**

### Visualize the track and LIDAR data

**TODO**
